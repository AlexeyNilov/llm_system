# Codex task state

## Current objective

Plan the thin free-form player-turn HTTP endpoint over the accepted transactional coordinator.

## Verified baseline

* M4 is complete: the singleton world persists and advances atomically through FastAPI, and the deterministic Streamlit page remains a thin HTTP client.
* TASK-041 is accepted at project version `0.40.0`.
* `NpcDecisionContext` is a strict immutable application contract containing only application identity, NPC identity context, goals, current plan, and actor-matching perception.
* `decide_greybridge_caretaker` is a pure deterministic proposal producer that uses typed observations for the seek, take, return, and reinforce sequence and falls back to a 60-second Wait.
* The policy receives no canonical world state, creates no trusted submission metadata, makes no LLM call, and performs no mutation or execution.
* TASK-042 is accepted at project version `0.41.0`.
* `HttpLocalModelGateway` uses explicit local configuration and the existing synchronous `httpx2` transport; no live service, new dependency, or environment loader was added.
* Functional calls disable Gemma thinking, request JSON-object syntax, validate only stopped non-blank `message.content` strictly, and make exactly one repair for invalid output.
* Typed immutable results preserve ordered attempt evidence; operational failures do not repair or expose provider details, and role-specific fallback remains outside the gateway.
* TASK-043 is accepted at project version `0.42.0`.
* `PlayerInterpreterOutput` strictly represents explicit private thought plus at most one Observe, Move, Speak, Take, Use, or Wait proposal, or clarification; Help and trusted metadata are excluded.
* `interpret_player_input` sends only deterministic instructions, exact player text, and current ID-linked perception through the injected gateway and preserves generation evidence.
* Gateway failure maps to one fixed clarification, while accepted model clarification is preserved; the service creates no identity, submission, execution, time, persistence, or narration effects.
* TASK-044 is accepted at project version `0.43.0`.
* Neutral immutable functional-generation and player-interpretation contracts preserve existing `llm_system.application` imports while allowing persistence to decode strict player-input records without importing application or HTTP code.
* `PlayerInputStepTrace` preserves exact interpretation evidence and has exactly thought-only, clarification, or action-linked completion forms. Action links must match an existing completed actor-action trace at the same world and resulting revision.
* SQLite V3 adds append-only player-input trace history, migrates V1/V2 records transactionally, and deletes that history during a development reset together with the existing timeline.
* TASK-045 is accepted at project version `0.44.0`.
* `coordinate_player_turn` reads perception outside a write transaction, rejects stale interpretations without identities or writes, and atomically commits either a no-action trace or the action/world/events/actor-trace/input-trace set.
* Parent verification passes: coordinator plus related 74-test suite, `make check` with 484 tests, `uv lock --check`, and `git diff --check`.

## Blockers and unresolved questions

No blocker. The next HTTP task needs a strict free-text request and player-safe result mapping over the coordinator; explicit local-gateway runtime configuration remains a separate follow-up.

## Exact next action

Specify the free-form HTTP request/response and stale mapping, then prepare the next Ready task without changing the deterministic structured `/turn` endpoint.
