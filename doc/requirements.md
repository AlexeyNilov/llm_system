# Requirements

## EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax)

Use the EARS structure for precise requirements:

> **While** `<optional precondition>`, **when** `<optional trigger>`, **the system shall** `<system response>`.

This helps ensure requirements are:

* Context-aware
* Trigger-based
* Action-specific

## Guidance

* Describe externally observable behavior and constraints, not implementation details.
* Give each requirement a stable identifier so designs, tests, and discussions can refer to it.
* Keep each requirement focused on one meaningful behavior.
* Add requirements only after they are accepted; keep unresolved questions outside this section.
* Update or supersede requirements explicitly instead of silently changing their meaning.

## Actual requirements

### World persistence

**WORLD-001:** The system shall operate with one persistent world and one player in the initial version.

**WORLD-002:** While a world exists, when the application restarts, the system shall restore the most recently committed canonical world state.

**WORLD-003:** When a simulation step completes successfully, the system shall persist its resulting canonical state before treating that step as complete.

**WORLD-004:** When an authorized development reset is requested, the system shall replace the current world with a known initial scenario.

**WORLD-005:** When a state transition is committed, the system shall retain an event record sufficient to inspect how the world reached its current state.

**WORLD-006:** While the application is not running, the world shall not advance automatically.
