# Decisions

## Why record decisions

Write down key development decisions while the context is fresh. A short note today can save hours later by explaining what was chosen, what was rejected, and why the trade-off made sense at the time.

## Guidance

Use a lightweight Architecture Decision Record (ADR) style:

* Record decisions that affect architecture, data flow, public APIs, dependencies, deployment, security, or long-term maintenance.
* Write the decision when it is made, not after the context has faded.
* Prefer short entries that explain the context, decision, alternatives, and consequences.
* Include enough reasoning for a future maintainer to understand the trade-off.
* Do not document every small implementation detail; focus on choices that would be costly or confusing to rediscover.
* Update or supersede earlier decisions instead of silently rewriting history.

## Entry template

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD: Decision title

**Status:** Proposed | Accepted | Superseded

**Context:** What problem, constraint, or trade-off led to this decision?

**Decision:** What was chosen?

**Alternatives considered:** What other options were rejected, and why?

**Consequences:** What becomes easier, harder, riskier, or more constrained?
```

## Actual decisions

### 2026-07-11: The simulation owns truth

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** LLMs will help describe the world, interpret player input, propose NPC actions, and generate events. If those LLMs can independently change reality, the world will become contradictory and difficult to inspect or test.

**Decision:** Canonical world state and resolved outcomes belong to the simulation. LLMs may interpret state, propose intentions, and narrate outcomes, but they may not directly establish or modify canonical facts. Proposed actions and events must pass through simulation rules before they take effect.

**Alternatives considered:** Treat an LLM conversation or generated narrative as the world state. This is simpler initially, but makes consistency, persistence, validation, and debugging unreliable.

**Consequences:** World state and events must have structured representations. The application must separate perception, intention, validation, state transition, and narration. LLM output must be treated as untrusted proposals, and deterministic tests can verify the simulation independently of generated prose.

### 2026-07-11: Agents receive bounded context

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** The intended experience is a persistent, inspectable simulation whose participants act from limited knowledge. Giving every LLM the complete world state would undermine believable perception and make prompts harder to reason about.

**Decision:** Each LLM-assisted participant receives a role-specific context assembled from its perception, relevant knowledge, goals, and memories. The player receives a personal narrative derived only from events and state they can perceive.

**Alternatives considered:** Give every participant the full simulation state. This reduces context-assembly work, but permits impossible knowledge, weakens agent identity, increases prompt size, and obscures information flow.

**Consequences:** Information architecture and context engineering are first-class parts of the design. Context sources, selection rules, provenance, and visibility boundaries must be explicit and inspectable. Different roles will require different context views over the same canonical state.

### 2026-07-11: Defer GraphRAG for the first NPC implementation

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** NPCs need identity, goals, relationships, knowledge, and memory, but the retrieval questions and graph traversal patterns are not yet known. Introducing GraphRAG now would add architectural complexity before its value can be demonstrated.

**Decision:** Begin with structured NPC profiles and simple episodic memory retrieval. Add graph-based retrieval only after concrete use cases show that relationships or multi-hop knowledge cannot be represented or retrieved adequately by the simpler design.

**Alternatives considered:** Build NPC knowledge around GraphRAG from the start. This offers richer relationships in principle, but risks optimizing infrastructure before validating NPC behavior.

**Consequences:** The initial NPC design remains smaller and easier to test. Data boundaries should still allow a later graph representation, but no speculative graph abstraction or dependency will be introduced.
